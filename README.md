Project to check real-time weather info.

The project is developed mainly in `Node.js` with `Express` webserver and templated with `Handlebars`

The project fetches the geographic location via [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) and the real-time weather status from [weatherstack](weatherstack.com).
Both sites provide free API with limited data access.
